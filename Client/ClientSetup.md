## âš¡ Step 5: Project Structure
```
Client/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/               # Static files (Logo, Favicon)
â”œâ”€â”€ src/                  # React Source Code
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ assets/           # Images and other static assets
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/       # Reusable React Components (Header, Footer, etc.)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ context/          # React Context (Global State)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pages/            # Individual Pages (Home, About, Events, etc.)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ styles/           # CSS/SCSS Files (themes.css, overrides.css)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ App.js            # Main React Component
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.js          # React Entry Point
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json          # React Dependencies and Scripts
â””â”€â”€ .gitignore            # Ignoring node_modules and other local files
```

## âš¡ Step 6: Environment Configuration (Optional)
- Create a `.env` file for environment variables (API URLs):
  ```bash
  touch .env
  ```

- Example Variables:
  ```
  REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
  ```

---

## âš¡ Step 7: Troubleshooting
- If you encounter any issues with missing modules:
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

- If the client does not start, ensure your `package.json` is not corrupted.

- If CSS is not loading properly, ensure Bootstrap is correctly imported in `index.js`:
  ```javascript
  import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';
  ```

---

## âš¡ Step 8: Contributing
- Ensure you pull the latest changes before starting work:
  ```bash
  git pull origin main
  ```

- Always use a new branch for new features:
  ```bash
  git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
  ```

- Make sure to follow the project coding standards.
